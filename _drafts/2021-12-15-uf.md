# Where is this useful?

In many problems, translating into a graph structure can prove helpful, as we can describe our problem in very abstract terms.

Once you've translated into this graph structure, often you might want to know whether two vertices are connected via a path, and if this is not the case, what two separate components they come from. Union Find allows us to not only answer this question, but slowly add edges to the graph and still answer these queries fast.

As such, Union Find is useful in any problem where connections are incrementally being added to some structure, and along the way you need to query what vertices are connected.

# Implementing the Data Structure

## Basics

Let's first define the interface for our Union Find. We want to provide the ability to merge two vertices, and we should be able to query two vertices, asking if they are connected.

At first, every vertex is disconnected. We can add edges later as need be.

```python
class UnionFind:
"""
vertices are represented as numbers 0->n-1.
"""

    def __init__(self, n):
        self.n = n

    def merge(self, a, b) -> bool:
        # Merge the two vertices a and b. Return a boolean which is true if they weren't already merged.
        pass # TODO

    def connected(self, a, b) -> bool:
        # Whether the two vertices a and b are connected.
        pass # TODO
```

</div>

<div id="UF-1-CPP" class="code-tabcontent UF-1" markdown="1">

```cpp
template<typename T = int> struct UnionFind {
    // vertices are represented as numbers 0->n-1.
    int n;

    UnionFind(int n) : n(n) { }

    bool merge(int a, int b) {
        // Merge the two vertices a and b. Return a boolean which is true if they weren't already merged.
        // TODO
    }

    bool connected(int a, int b) {
        // Whether the two vertices a and b are connected.
        // TODO
    }
}
```

</div>

Now, we can take our first approach at the data structure. Notice that before any merging occurs, each component is uniquely identified by a single vertex contained within. As we merge our vertices, we'll try keep it that way.

In order to do this, we can model each component as a rooted tree. The root of this tree is the identifier, and so from any vertex in the tree, we can get to the identifier by moving up the tree.

To merge two components (trees), we simply place the second tree as a child of the first tree. The second root no longer identifies a component, and the first root is now the identifier of the combined component.

So, to implement this, we'll create a parent array, which contains the parent of each vertex. For vertices that are the root, they will be their own parents.

We will also need a method to find the identifier of any component, by moving up the tree. We will do this with `find` in the code.

And we can already get around to implementing `connected` and `merge`. For `connected`, `a` and `b` are in the same component if the identifier of their components are the same. For merge, we simply need to modify the `parent` attribute of one identifier, so that it points to the root of the other component:

## Useful data

A keen eye might've spotted that there's possibility of some bad complexity coming out of these methods. If components are merged badly (So that we have a very unbalanced tree) we can make it so that `find` (and therefore `merge/connected`) are `O(n)` complexity. To improve this, and to make the data structure more useful as a whole, let's take a quick detour and try to include some other data as part of our data structure:

* `size`: This should be an array which stores the size of each component. The `size` entry for non-identifier vertices doesn't matter and can be left with old data.
* `rank`: This should be an array which stores the maximum depth of any component tree. The `rank` entry for non-identifier vertices doesn't matter and can be left with old data.

It could be a good bit of practice to try this yourself; Modify the methods above to store and update the `size` and `rank` values.

If the maximum of `rank[a]` and `rank[b]` is equal to `rank[b]`, then the total depth in the tree will be at most `rank[b]+1`, since we must include the path from `a` to `b`, before considering any children of `b`.

Armed with this information, we can make some better decisions when it comes to merging, and also start compressing the trees.
## Depth reduction

Since we get bad complexity when merging trees with large rank as children, let's always pick the largest rank tree to be the identifier. Then the overall rank of the resultant tree only increases if the rank of the two original trees was the same.

Additionally, every time we call find, we are traversing up our tree. But in this traversal, it is very cheap to simply connect every vertex along the way to the root vertex, using recursion.

## Complexity Analysis

And that is all the changes required to reduce the complexity of union find, but how much has it done?

Well, to construct a rank 2 tree we need to merge 2 rank 1 trees, to construct a rank 3 tree we need to merge 2 rank 2 trees, and so on and so forth. Therefore in a union find with n vertices, we have at most log2(n) rank on each tree in our data structure.

This means that `find` is log(n), meaning both `merge` and `connected` are also log(n). (In fact, with the path compression above, the complexity is even less (inverse ackermann), but this isn't super important under contest conditions)

And that's the data structure fully taken care of. Now let's solve some problems!
