# Where is this useful?

The Least Common Ancestor (LCA) data structure is useful wherever you have a directed graph where every vertex has out-degree \\(\leq 1\\). In more common terms, each vertex has a unique determined 'parent', or it is a root node, with no parent. The most common (and almost always only) example being a rooted tree.

On these particular graphs, the LCA gives us a fast way to move 'up' the graph (Towards your parents). In particular, we can use this to find the least common ancestor in \\(\log (N)\\) time, where the data structure gets its name from.

Reusing the analogy of parenting vertices, a vertex \\(u\\) is an ancestor of \\(v\\) if \\(u\\) is \\(v\\)'s parent, or \\(v\\)'s parent's parent, and so on. As long as there is a line of 'parentage' connecting \\(v\\) to \\(u\\), \\(u\\) is an ancestor of \\(v\\). We consider \\(v\\) to also be it's own ancestor.

The least common ancestor problem then requires, given two vertices \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), to find a vertex \\(z\\) in the graph such that \\(z\\) is an ancestor of both \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), but there is no vertex \\(z' \neq z\\) such that \\(z\\) is an ancestor of \\(z'\\) and \\(z'\\) is an ancestor of \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) (In the tree example, we just want to find the lowest depth vertex whose subtree contains boths \\(x\\) and \\(y\\)).

Note that the least common ancestor can be \\(x\\) or \\(y\\), if \\(x\\) is an ancestor of \\(y\\) or vice-versa.

# Implementing the Data Structure

## Interface

Let's start by defining an interface for this data structure, and then slowly implement our methods.

## Useful data

First off, let's save some intermediary data that will make our life a lot easier, and strictly define the tree structure.
We'll introduce three arrays: `parent`, `level` and `length`.

* `parent` stores the direct parent of any vertex in the rooted tree.
* `level` stores the level of the tree the vertex is at (Number of edges from it to the root)
* `length` stores the length of the vertex to the root (Using edge weights).

We'll populate these fields in the `build` method, since all edges should be added by then.

So now we can query many useful characteristics of vertices in rooted trees. Now for the interesting part: let's start creating data unique to the LCA structure.

## Ancestor Array

LCA gets its fast queries by precomputing a special array, called `ancestor`. Ancestor is a 2 dimensional array with `ancestor[v][k]` storing the ancestor of vertex `v` \\(2^k\\) edges towards the root. As an example, `ancestor[v][0]` is `parent[v]` (Parent is just ancestor 1 edge towards the root), and `ancestor[v][1]` is `parent[parent[v]]` where appropriate (2 edges towards root is same as parent's parent).

![](/assets/img/posts/lca/graph-0.png)

If you just populated this array by searching up the tree \\(2^k\\) steps each time, you'd have worst case complexity \\(O(n^2)\\) to build the array. Luckily, we can use the fact that `ancestor[v][k] = ancestor[ancestor[v][k-1]][k-1]` (In other words, you can move \\(2^k\\) steps towards the root by first moving \\(2^{k-1}\\) steps, which we've already computed, and then another \\(2^{k-1}\\) steps from this new position). This reduces the complexity to \\(O(n\log_2(n))\\)

We do this so that we can find the ancestor \\(m\\) edges towards the root for any arbitrary \\(m\\) in \\(\log_2(m)\\) time, while only using \\(\log_2(n)\\) space. We'll see how this gets done later.

## Query

That's actually most of the ingenuity out of the way, now we can get to implementing `query`.

Provided we want the LCA with respect to the root we called `build` from, we can define the LCA `l` of `u` and `v` in the following way:

`l` is the ancestor of `u` and `v` maximising `level[l]`.

We also know that `level[l] <= min(level[u], level[v])`. Using this, we can calculate `query(u, v)` by:

* Finding the ancestors of `u` and `v` (call them `a1`, `a2`) such that `level[a1] = level[a2] = min(level[u], level[v])`.
* Keep moving `a1` and `a2` towards the root (higher and higher ancestors) until `a1 == a2`. Then `a1` and `a2` are the LCA of `u` and `v`.

We can do both of these things on \\(\log_2(n)\\) time with this `ancestor` array we've generated. Let's see how:

Nice! That's the main functionality of LCA completed.

## Corrolaries

Let's quickly tackle the two remaining implementations:

* Calculating the distance between two vertices `u` and `v` is the same as calculating the distance between `u` and `query(u, v)`, and adding that to the distance between `v` and `query(u, v)`
* Calculating the LCA from a particular root, just requires a slight change in perspective. For two vertices `u` and `v`, and custom root `r`, the LCA will always be one of `query(u, v)`, `query(u, r)` or `query(v, r)`.
