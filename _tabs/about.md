This site is a collection of problem solving techniques, with related problems and implementations in Python + CPP.
It also houses a printable binder for use in contests (COMING SOON).

If you'd like to contribute, please let me know (on Discord, jackson#5358) and I can add you to the project.

Any and all recommendations for particular problems or algorithms is also appreciated.
